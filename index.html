        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Connor Homayouni, a technology-focused student with a 3.91 GPA in Information Technology and Human-Computer Interaction from Oakland University. I've gained hands-on experience in Information Technology through internships and part-time positions, including serving as an IT Support Technician where I diagnosed and managed technical problems and maintained software security. 
            My thesis, "Welcome to the Tinder-Verse: Preventing Sexual Harm with Virtual Reality," showcases my passion for using technology to improve people's lives. 
            I'm also a skilled project manager, having successfully facilitated the management and delegation of tasks to multiple groups as part of an HCI Research and Design team. 
            My technical skills include Bash Shell, Linux, Windows Server, SQL, Active Directory, and computer hardware, while my communication skills and emotional intelligence make me a valuable team player. 
            Outside of work, I enjoy 3D-printing, woodworking, video games, traveling, cycling, fencing, and cooking.</p>
